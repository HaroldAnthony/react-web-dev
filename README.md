My React.js-powered e-commerce platform (hopefully this builds up into a proper, dynamic project that I can envision and aggressively manifest)

26-07-2024 12:47 - I had performed the terminal command <b><i>"npx create-react-app myapp"</i></b>, which resulted in an error. Turns out I had performed <b><i>"npm install create-react-app"</i></b> (which only installs the framework locally, for the previous project), instead of <b><i>"npm install -g create-react-app"</i></b> , where the -g flag installs it globally, so I rectified the problem. 
<p>I also performed the appropriate deletions and editing, to conform to the React folder structure that is actually required, and voila! First day went well!</p>
