My React.js-powered e-commerce platform (hopefully this builds up into a proper, dynamic project that I can envision and aggressively manifest)

26-07-2024 12:47 - performed the terminal command <b>"npx create-react-app myapp"</b>, which resulted in an error. Turns out I had performed "npm install create-react-app" (which only installs the framework locally, for the previous project), instead of "npm install -g create-react-app", where the -g flag installs it globally, so I rectified the problem. I also performed the appropriate deletions and editing, to conform to the React folder structure that is actually required, and voila! First day went well!
