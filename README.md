The repository that deals with my React Native-based learning, understanding concepts on a basic level before moving onto building React.js projects.

<b>26-07-2024 12:47</b> - I had performed the terminal command <b><i>"npx create-react-app myapp"</i></b>, which resulted in an error. Turns out I had performed <b><i>"npm install create-react-app"</i></b> (which only installs the framework locally, for the previous project), instead of <b><i>"npm install -g create-react-app"</i></b> , where the -g flag installs it globally, so I rectified the problem.
<p>I also performed the appropriate deletions and editing, to conform to the React folder structure that is actually required, and voila! First day went well!</p>

<br>

<b>08-08-2024 13:36</b> - The following activities were completed by the 8th of August, 2024 - 
<p><b>1) Camelcase naming - </b>The individual component files, to be integrated into <b>App.js</b>, were appropriately converted to Camelcase, to avoid errors with the usual lowercase HTML tags.</p>
<p><b>2) JSX conversion - </b>The .js files were appropriately converted into .jsx files, for React compatibility.</p>
<p><b>3) CSS integration - </b>The <b>"class"</b> to <b>"className"</b> conversion was performed, and separate components folder + separate .js+.css file pairs were created.</p>
<p><b>4) Identical className error - </b>conversion of naming into (eg)- <b>header.module.css</b> + conversion of import into (eg)- <b>import styles from "./header.module.css"</b> + conversion of className into (eg)- <b>className = {styles.header}</b>, to avoid this specific error.</p>

<b>12-08-2024 11:40</b> - After exploring the possibilities with the <b>useState</b> React hook, the entire day was spent working on the various forms of the <b>props</b> hook, conveying with functions and objects as well.

<br>

<b>13-08-2024 12:40</b> - With the learning of the <b>useEffect</b> hook, combining it with the usual <b>useState</b> hook, I am finally done with all the React Native concepts, and ready to move onto project-based learning (which already sounds exciting in my head!).
